# Statistiker

Statistiker is a simple way to do Statistics in Clojure.
The goal is to have an implementation of all popular algorithms 
for mining datasets.

## Project Goals

 * Provide a Clojure-friendly, easy way for statistical analysis, inference and machine learning
 * Be reasonably feature-complete (provide majority of things an advanced user may demand)
 * Be well maintained.
 * Be well documented.
 * Be well tested.
 
 
## Project Maturity

Statistiker is a young and incomplete project. There may be major API 
changes (conforming to semantic versioning) inbetween releases.
