# Statistiker

Statistiker is a simple way to do Statistics in Clojure.
The goal is to have an implementation of all popular algorithms 
for mining datasets.

## Project Goals

 * Provide a Clojure-friendly, easy way for statistical analysis, inference and machine leraning
 * Be reasonably feature-complete (provide majority of things an advanced user may demand)
 * Be well maintained.
 * Be well documented.
 * Be well tested.
 
 
## Project Maturity

Statistiker is a young and incomplete project. There may be major API 
changes (conforming to semantic versioning) inbetween releases.

LibSVM sources belong to their respected owners, except for the changes our team made to the source code.

The project repository contains several public datasets, added to provide best available examples for
the users to start exploring the project with realistic data. The Data sets belong to their respective owners,
specified in the description. The data sets are same as in Python's `scikit-learn`.
